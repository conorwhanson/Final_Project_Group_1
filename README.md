# Predicting Employee Attrition with Supervised Machine Learning

This project will cover building a SQLite database to store employee attrition data, from which a machine learning model will be built to predict employee attrition. This will be hosted on a webpage with an interactive predictor into which users can set parameters to see what may contribute to employee attrition.

### Communication
We will communicate via Slack and assign tasks to complete for each team member. We will use Tuesday and Thursday class times to check in on each team member's progress.
